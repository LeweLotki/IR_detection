# IR_detection

This repository was created to build binary classificator, which will be able to detect humans with IR camera.
For training purpose FLIR ADAS dataset has been used, which can be found under this link https://adas-dataset-v2.flirconservator.com/#downloadguide.

Require modules can be found in Requirements.txt

$ git clone https://github.com/LeweLotki/IR_detection/tree/master.git <br />
$ cd IR_detection <br />
$ python main.py
